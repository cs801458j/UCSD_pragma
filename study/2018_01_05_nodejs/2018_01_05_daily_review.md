## What I do today


### Study React.js and Node.js

I'm not familiar with React yet, so I looked for React.js today.
I visited the React site, but I had some basic knowledge to understand React.
I also looked up MDN(Mozilla Developer Network) to understand the upgraded JavaScript syntax.
And I've read posts about react and node written by Korean developers.
Some of the blogs are written by Korean bloggers. I am sorry about this point.
