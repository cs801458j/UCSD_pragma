## What I do today


### Study React.js and Node.js

I'm not familiar with React yet, so I looked for React.js today.
I visited the React site, but I had some basic knowledge to understand React.
I also looked up MDN(Mozilla Developer Network) to understand the upgraded JavaScript syntax.
And I've read posts about react and node written by Korean developers.
Some of the blogs are written by Korean bloggers. I am sorry about this point.

- [React homepage](https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html)
- [Node.js v9.3.0 documentation](https://nodejs.org/api/documentation.html)
- [A re-introduction to JavaScript (JS tutorial)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/A_re-introduction_to_JavaScript)
- [진짜기초 Node.js(Real_basic Node.js)](https://www.slideshare.net/WooGenius/nodejs-40451587)
- [require과 import의 차이 (The difference between require and import)](https://blueshw.github.io/2017/05/16/ES-require-vs-import/)
- [React.js 강좌 (React.js lecture)](https://velopert.com/775)

### Usage of Markdown 

I was wondering how to record the daily work and chose to record it as a Markdown document.
I looked up usage of Markdown. 
- [마크다운 사용법(Markdown Usage)](https://gist.github.com/ihoneymon/652be052a0727ad59601)
- [StackEdit](https://stackedit.io/editor#publish-a-document)

So I wrote down 2 documents by using Markdown grammer. 
Those are in docs directory.(But these were written in Korean)

### Future Plans

It will take a few more days to get used to Reacts and Nodejs.
I will study more through these sites.
